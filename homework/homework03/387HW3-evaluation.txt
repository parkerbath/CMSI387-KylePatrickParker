Pretty good job here, just a couple of notes:

No dining philosophers program in your repo, but it's in your markdown file
so I almost didn't spot it.  It's a good idea in courses like this, which
are program-based, to put your code into a separate source file.  However,
when I compile it there are several warning messages about deprecated and
mis-matched things.  You should definitely clean those things up before you
submit your code.

The other thing about dining philosophers is that the program should keep on
running and not stop unless a deadlock occurs.  Yours goes for a while, then
stops by itself.  The whole point of a deadlock demonstrator is to show that
the program can run forever.  Still, it runs, so you earn nearly all credit.

Everything else looks fine.

SEMESTER SO FAR, COMING UP TO FINAL EXAM:
   homework01:  11/12 =  91.67% of 10 pts =  9.17 pts
   homework02:  92/97 =  94.85% of 10 pts =  9.49 pts
   homework03:  78/80 =  97.50% of 10 pts =  9.75 pts
        total:                              28.41 pts out of 30.00
