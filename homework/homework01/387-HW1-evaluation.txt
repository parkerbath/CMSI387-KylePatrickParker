Nice work!

Thanks for your input about topics you favor.  WOW, that's pretty broad!
I can get into networking and security, together and separately, later in
the semester.  I'm not sure what you mean by "data gathering" though?  I'd
like to find out more about what things you'd like to learn there.....

You obviously spent some effort on question 6 with the three threads, but
you didn't indicate what type of scheduling is reflected by the shortest
average turnaround time.  I can see for myself the result of your numbers,
but without some column headers on the table it's not 100% certain which
thing is which.  It would be helpful for you to include some labels when
you do this kind of thing.....  just sayin'.....

Also, it would be most helpful if you include source code in its own file,
so that I can compile/run it.  It's not as important for trivial programs
like in this set, but in future assignments it would be appreciated.

Otherwise, nice work!
