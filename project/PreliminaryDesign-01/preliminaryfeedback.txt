"allVersions" ~ adding command to check/update all versions

What an interesting concept this one is!  I like the idea of making this an
automatic function!  There are some caveats.....

First of all this is NOT really a "kernel" modification or addition.  This
is a utility.  However, you might be able to add it to 'common utilities' in
the Linux directory hierarchy to make something that will integrate with the
O/S.

Second, this is an ambitious project for one semester.  It's gonna take a lot
of work doing searches and trial-and-error to make this work correctly.  There
are things to consider, like what if the user wants to update NEARLY all of
the installed things, but NOT 100% of them ~ will they be given an option to
do an update on just part of the installed base?  What if the user only wants
to update ONE thing?  What if there is an error during the update?  What if
the user loses connectivity?

These are NOT questions to keep you from doing this, or to say it's a bad idea
by any means.  It's a GOOD idea, just gonna be involved.  However, I'm sure if
you work diligently, you'll pull it off!

A useful idea and you three are conceptualizing programmer tools, which is
really great!

Semester so far:
   homework01 91.67% * 10 points =  9.17 points
   delivery01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                          total:   19.17 out of 20 = 95.85% which is an A

Keep thinking up these good ideas!
