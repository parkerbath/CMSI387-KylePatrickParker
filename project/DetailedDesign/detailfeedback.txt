Evaluation and Feedback
======================================================

Nice pivot!  Looks like this will be a fun project.

Keyloggers are very useful, but be aware that they are also hacking tools, so
you may get some "interesting" looks when you describe this project when on
an interview...... not that it's bad, just sayin'......

What will your new module be called?  Since you didn't do a preliminary doc
for this, a wee bit more detail would be good.  If you'll add a few more of
the details of what you are doing, you can boost this up to full credit.  By
the end of the semester, add in:

   the name of the project
   the command used to run it
   a list of all switches that will be used on the command line
      like "-s" or "-l" or something
   a description of where the output will go [probably the kernel log file]

The details you put into section 2.4 are not what is intended.  Change that
section to contain the third item above.

A useful idea and you three are conceptualizing programmer tools, which is
really great!

Full credit earned.

Semester so far:
   homework01  91.67% * 10 points =  9.17 points
   homework02  92.00% * 10 points =  9.20 points
   delivery01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery02  80.00% * 10 points =  8.00 points
                           total:   36.37 out of 40 = 90.93% which is an A-minus

Keep thinking up these good ideas!
